### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hope you not expected things from me, because i will not be the person who have bright idea or anything like that...

## Basic info
- Second year in HCMUS-VNU.
- Have plan to learn (every) as many popular programme language as possible, like JS, Python or C#...
- Shining brightest at software developing.
- Want to collab as much as i can, because i lack experience.
- Free to chat about anything, i can be your listener...
- Active the most on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Quang.Nguyen.Duy.Nhoi/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/yume#1170). Not so sure about the other like Outlook or Gmail or whatever, but will try my best.
- Maybe not-fun-fact, but, well, just look at my avatar...
