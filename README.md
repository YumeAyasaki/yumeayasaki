### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hope you do not expect things from me, because I will not be the person who has a bright idea or anything like that...

## Basic info
- Fourth-year in HCMUS-VNU.
- Have a plan to learn (every) as many popular program languages as possible, like JS, Python, or C#...
- Shining brightest at software development.
- Want to collab as much as I can, because I lack experience.
- Free to chat about anything, I can be your listener...
- Active the most on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Quang.Nguyen.Duy.Nhoi/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/yume#1170). Not so sure about the others like Outlook or Gmail or whatever, but will try my best.
- Maybe not-fun-fact, but, well, just look at my avatar...
